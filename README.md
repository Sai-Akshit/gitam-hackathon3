## Problem Statement

Students today rely heavily on study materials delivered in Portable Document Format (PDF).  These documents can range from 10 to 50 pages in length, often containing a wealth of information crucial for academic success. However, extracting key points from such PDFs presents a significant challenge:

1. **Information Overload:** The sheer volume of content within a PDF can be overwhelming. Identifying relevant information becomes a time-consuming task.
2. **Scattered Knowledge:** Often, crucial information is spread across different sections of the PDF, making it difficult to compile a comprehensive understanding of the topic. 
3. **Inefficient Learning:** Manually searching through a PDF to find specific details is a slow and laborious process. This reduces valuable study time and hinders knowledge retention.

These challenges have a direct impact on student learning:

1. **Wasted Time:** Students spend a significant amount of time searching for information instead of actively engaging with the content.
2. **Reduced Performance:** The inefficiency of traditional methods can hinder comprehension and lead to poorer academic performance.
3. **Increased Stress:** The struggle to navigate complex PDFs can contribute to student stress and anxiety.

There is a clear need for a solution that addresses these issues and empowers students to extract information from study PDFs more effectively, leading to a more efficient and successful learning process.
